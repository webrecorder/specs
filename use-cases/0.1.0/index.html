    This document was published by the [Webrecorder Project](https://webrecorder.net) as part of a [grant](https://github.com/webrecorder/devgrants/blob/browser-based-web-archiving/open-grants/open-proposal-browser-based-web-archiving.md) from the [FileCoin Foundation](https://fil.org/). It is being actively developed and feedback on new use cases is encouraged using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/webrecorder/specs/issues/).

# Introduction

## Motivation

<p class="ednote" title="TODO">
This section will include a few paragraphs about what we mean by
decentralized web archives and why web archives and their decentralization are
are important. It is also probably important to delimit the scope: archives of
HTTP transactions, not new protocols IPFS. But leave open possibility of
interactions between HTTP and other protocols?
</p>

The goal of this specification is to provide a portable format for web
archives...

## Existing Work

<p class="ednote" title="TODO">
This section will provide a sketch of related web packaging work. This should
include other approaches to storing HTTP transactions such as: HAR, Web Bundle,
ZIM, SinglePage, wpack.
</p>

## Concepts of Distributed Web Archives

<p class="ednote" title="TODO">
Glossary of terms that are useful for understanding the use cases.

# Use Cases

<p class="ednote" title="TODO">
Distinguish between uses and threats here. Give some background on how the use
cases were collected.
</p>

## Researcher saves an article 

A researcher wants to save an interactive article they're using browsing for
later use in their research. They’ve bookmarked the page, but want to ensure
they have a copy in case it disappears, changes or becomes paywalled. They use
the browser to create a web archive (saved in the browser as well) and then
download a local copy of the article as a file just in case. They do not intend
to share this article with anyone else.

**Requirements:** [= Manual =], [= Public =]

## Social media user preserves and deletes account

A social media user wants to use their browser to archive their public profile, and make it available on their personal website, before canceling their account.

**Requirements:** [= Description =], [= Aggregated =], [= Manual =], [= Public
=], [= Published =]

## Curator preserves application in an institutional repository

A creator of a digital humanities project no longer has resources to maintain an aging web application. They use an automated crawler to produce a high fidelity web archive, and host the web archive in their digital repository system without any additional costs, providing replayweb.page as the access.

**Requirements:** [= List =], [= Search =], [= Description =], [= Automatic =],
[= Public =], [= Published =]

## Preserving organizational social media accounts in institional repository

A librarian at a university needs to archive their organizations' social media pages. The librarian uses the browser to archive their social media manually, or uses a service to automate the process. The resulting files are deposited into their institutional repository, along with other digital artifacts.

**Requirements:** [= List =], [= Search =], [= Technical =], [= Description =],
[= Aggregated =], [= Logs =], [= Manual =], [= Automatic =], [= Public =], [=
Published =]

## Resources for investigative journalism

A journalist uses their browser and the Tor network to create archives of
primary source material, documenting sources which may be sensitive and may be
deleted in the future, including social media posts. They ensure the data is
archived and store the file in encrypted storage. The archive indicates that Tor
was being used to access the web content.

**Requirements:** [= Technical =], [= Description =], [= Encryption =], [=
Authenticity =], [= Private =], [= Share =]

## Curate art works for transfer to museum

A net artist meticulously browses their interactive art piece to fully archive
their work, which includes an old Flash piece. The resulting archive is then donated to a museum for preservation.

**Requirements:** [= List =], [= Description =], [= Authenticity =], [=
Aggregated =], [= Manual =], [= Public =], [= Share =]

## Aggregate access to routine automated crawls

A crawling service runs repeated crawls of a list of seeds, producing a weekly
crawl. Each crawl is stored as its own file. The entire collection of crawls is
available for access together, or each crawl at a time as a file. Users can
download their archive files at any time.

**Requirements:** [= List =], [= Search =], [= Technical =], [= Description =],
[= Aggregated =], [= Logs =], [= Automatic =], [= Public =], [= Published =]

## Author copies of work published elsewhere on the web

A data journalist uses the browser to archive their previous work, to ensure they have their own copies, in case their publisher goes out of business.

**Requirements:** [= List =], [= Search =], [= Description =], [= Manual =], [=
Automatic =], [= Public =], [= Published =]

## Author archives cited resources

An author of a scholarly work archives cited open web resources so that these
can later be deposited in a repository or submitted to a publisher along with
the manuscript. The author carries out the archiving as close in time as
possible to the inclusion of the citation, and reviews the fidelity of the
archival snapshot to minimize the potential for content drift.

**Requirements:** [= Manual =], [= Share =], [= Fidelity =]

## Locally hosted copies of at risk video to guard against link rot

A news site uses the browser to create an archive of a tweet that contains a video they would like to use in a news story, downloading the file and embedding it into their page instead of the live tweet, which may be deleted. The news site hosts the file in their CMS along with other content.

**Requirements:** [= Authenticity =], [= Manual =], [= Public =], [= Published
=]

## Extract collection from larger archive for research

A researcher requests web archive data for a specific domain from a larger
national archive, which has been crawling the site for years. The archive has
the data in WARCs, indexes in a different system, and metadata in its own custom
database, and full text search in Solr. The web archive extracts just requested
data from its multi-PB archive, and offers it to the researcher as a file
so that they may easily browse the archive using a standard viewer.

**Requirements:** [= Technical =], [= Description =], [= Authenticity =], [=
Aggregated =], [= Automatic =]

## Requesting materials during electronic discovery

A lawyer requests web archive data or archives web material as part of an
ongoing civil or criminal case. Whether building a defense for the defendant or
a case for the plaintiff, the archive must support efficient traversal after the
capture process, and support exporting in multiple formats (including paper
formats) to be entered as evidence. Additional chain of custody and/or forgery
defenses potentially may also be beneficial.

**Requirements:** [= List =], [= Search =], [= Technical =], [= Description =],
[= Authenticity =], [= Logs =], [= Manual =], [= Automatic =]

## Manuscript publication

A disinformation platform deploys web archives to help informants produce
evidence of coordinated international propaganda campaigns. Web archives are
provided as one of many options for “tip submission,” and may be submitted
alongside any other form of evidence (screenshot, photograph, text description,
blobs shared between apps, etc).

**Requirements:** [= Search =], [= Technical =], [= Description =], [=
Screenshots =], [= Manual =]

## Reconstructing local archive of lost website 

A website owner retrieves lost website content from one or more web archives and assembles this into a local, consolidated archive (e.g., like Warrick, except saving to a more robust archival format). Ideally, this operation would leverage Memento, both for the best possible coverage but also to assemble the most temporally coherent archive.

**Requirements:** [= List =], [= Automatic =], [= Public =], [= Published =]

## Extracting web pages from web archive for local full text search

A user wants to retrieve a bundle of webpages from a web archive (e.g., via batch downloading URLs identified and filtered using the Wayback CDX Server API) so that full-text search can be more easily performed upon the corpus (i.e., and where full-text search isn't otherwise offered by the web archive platform).

**Requirements:** [= Search =], [= Automatic =], [= Public =], [= Published =]

## Court staff archive open web resources cited in opinions

Court staff archive open web resources cited in opinions issued by that court. The citations in the published opinions link to the archived versions rather than the live web resources. This mitigates content drift and ensures that the court continues to point to the versions of the cited resources that it considers to be canonical for the purposes of the opinion.

**Requirements:** [= Authenticity =], [= Manual =], [= Public =], [= Published
=]

## Offline first curriculum materials

Students are given laptops with WACZ versions of web-based curriculum materials and a replay tool preinstalled. Instructors can update materials as needed by using a self-directed archiving tool.

**Requirements:** [= List =], [= Manual =], [= Automatic =], [= Public =], [=
Published =]

## Evaluate trust in the creator of a web archive

As someone looking at a web archive in the context of a web post (e.g. blog or entry on CMS) I want to evaluate whether I want to see who created the archive (not just who is publishing it) to establish if I trust them or not. It would also be useful to see who else trusts the creator as well.

**Requirements:** [= Authenticity =], [= Manual =], [= Automatic =] 

## Repatriate web content

A human rights activist wants to be able to archive a website that is at risk
due to political instability, censorship, and war in the area where the website
is being served from. The activist would like to repatriate this content to the
original publishers and community once the political instability has ceased.
Ideally the content could be delivered via the network or on physical media such
as an external hard disk or thumb drive.

**Requirements:** [= Authenticity =], [= Share =], [= Consent =]

    <section id="threats" data-format="markdown">

# Threats

## Archived web content as evidentiary weapon

A member of a harassment community collects the output of a targeted individual. Here, the goal is to develop a richly detailed database of said individuals -- both of their own output, but also material related to them (online criminal records, sensitive photos, previous aliases, abandoned online presences, etc).

**Requirements:** [= Search =], [= Aggregated =]

## Web archive for delivering trojan attack

A state actor is aware of a team of investigative reporters using web archives, and seeks to leverage the format as an unusual vector for deploying web-based attack payloads.

**Requirements:** 

## Surveillance and disinformation campaigns

A political operative continually monitors the material produced by their
opponents as a form of surveillance. Working solo or as part of a larger
organization, they store large collections of material to recall, publish,
manipulate or doctor later. Here, metadata and data integrity may not be
important; instead they will use the web archive to hit their targets based
solely on the content of the media or its potential with minor changes. They may
even produce a customised web archive-supporting tool to simplify this process.

**Requirements:** [= List =], [= Aggregated =], [= Public =], [= Share =]

## Trauma when reviewing content

An archivist for an activist organization is responsible for reviewing content
that has been archived by an automated data collection process. They open the
web archive and are immediately presented with a large amount of traumatic
imagery related to the recent death of fellow activist. This experience
continues as they browse through the archive, until they are unable to continue
to review the content and they close it, leaving it to the next archivist to
process.

**Requirements:** [= Description =], [= Authenticity =], [= Screenshots =], [=
List =]

## Journalist gets hacked

An investigative journalist uses their browser to create archives of a social
media post that requires a login. The archive is then published and a malicious
actor uses information contained in the archive to create fraudulent social
media posts that appear to be authored by the journalist. 

**Requirements:** [= Authenticity =], [= Published =], [= Security =]
