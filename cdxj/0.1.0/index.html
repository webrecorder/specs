      This specification details the CDXJ format for representing web archive
      indexes that are used to locate relevant records in WARC data. Each CDXJ
      entry can be looked up by URL, and contains a JSON payload that can be
      used for representing information about that URL. It is used
      in the WACZ specification, but is specified here for potential use in
      other contexts and applications.

## Introduction

Crawl Index JSON or CDXJ provides a standardized way of representing an index to
one or more <a>WARC</a> files. It allows applications to quickly locate a given
<a>page</a> in a set of archived web content, as well as metadata associated
with that page. A reference implementation can be
found in the [cdxj-indexer](https://github.com/webrecorder/cdxj-indexer) project. 

CDXJ's name and semantics partly derive from an earlier index format
developed as part of the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, where CDX
may have been an acronym for Crawl (or Capture) inDeX. The CDXJ format used in
WACZ was mostly drawn from an earlier implementation in the Webrecorder
application [[WEBRECORDER-CDX]].

A CDXJ file is a sorted, line oriented plain-text file (optionally GZIP
compressed) where each line represents information about a single capture in a
web archive collection.

Each line MUST have three components that are separated by single spaces (0x20):

1. a Searchable URL
2. an Integer Timestamp
3. a JSON Block 

    </section>

    <section id="searchable-url" data-format="markdown">

## Searchable URL

The Searchable URL is a normalized form of the archived URL that allows a
CDXJ file to be sorted and efficiently scanned using a binary search algorithm.
The Searchable URL is sometimes referred to as Sort-friendly URI Reordering
Transform (SURT).

The steps for creating a Searchable URL from a URL are:

1. lowercasing the URL
2. removing the protocol portion (HTTP or HTTPS)
3. replacing the host name portion of the URL with a reversed, comma separated
equivalent: `www.example.org becomes `org,example,www`
4. adding a `)` separator
5. adding the remaining portion of the URL (path and query)

For example the URL ```https://www.example.org/index.html``` would be
represented as this Searchable URL ```org,example,www)/index.html```

  </section>

  <section id="timestamp" data-format="markdown">

## Integer Timestamp

The Integer Timestamp is an integer representation of the date and time (UTC)
when the web archive snapshot was created. It is composed of:

- 4 digit year (e.g. 2022)
- 2 digit month (e.g. 02)
- 2 digit day (e.g. 05)
- 2 digit hour in 24 hour format (e.g. 23)
- 2 digit minute (e.g. 13)
- 2 digit second (e.g. 59)
- 3 digit milliseconds MAY be included (e.g. 032)

This example date would get serialized as the Integer Timestamp
`20220205231359032`.

    </section>

    <section id="json-block" data-format="markdown">

## JSON Block 

The JSON Block contains a serialized [[JSON]] object with newlines escaped so
that it fits completely on one line. The object MUST contain the following
properties:

- url: The URL that was archived
- digest: A cryptographic hash for the HTTP response payload
- mime: The <a>media type</a> for the response payload
- filename: the WARC file where the WARC record is located
- offset: the byte offset for the WARC record
- length: the length in bytes of the WARC record
- status: the HTTP status code for the HTTP response

    </section>

    <section id="sorting" data-format="markdown">

## Sorting

The lines in a CDXJ file MUST be sorted to allow a given URL (and timestamp) to
be looked up efficiently using a simple binary search. The sorting should be
done based on the native byte values of the characters. This is equivalent to
using the GNU sort with the collation settings `LC_ALL=C`.

    </section>

    <section id="example" data-format="markdown">

## Example

The following is an example of a complete line from a CDXJ file:

```
org,example)/index.html 20220106150849300 {"url":"https://example.org/index.html","digest":"sha-256:a8c5ac6f47aa34c5c5183daedc6ebbc7ca1e53fd2ec7db5e98d71bffb163b2ce","mime":"image/png","offset":283,"length":2269,"recordDigest":"sha256:e520b333999144ff38f593f6d76f5333d24895701953b2ea0507ed041d20ca2c","status":200,"filename":"data.warc.gz"}
```

A typical CDXJ file will contain many such lines.
