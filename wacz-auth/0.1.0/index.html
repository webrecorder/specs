# Introduction

This document is a working draft for a proposal to create signed WACZ packages
which allow the package's author to be cryptographically proven.

## Motivation

The purpose of this specification is to provide an optional mechanism to make
web archives bundled in WACZ more trusted.

The WACZ format provides a way to create portable web archives and distribute
them through any online network in a decentralized manner.

To increase trust in web archives, it becomes necessary to guarantee certain
properties about who the web archive was created and when.

## Proof of Authenticity

Proving web archive authenticity can be difficult. Ideally, proof of
authenticity could guarantee that any web server served a particular URL at a
particular point in time. Unfortunately, this is not currently possible with
existing web standards, as even TLS does not provide "non-repudiation".

There are proposals, such as [signed
exchanges](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses.html),
which provide new ways for web servers to serve content that could later be
verified. However, this requires HTTPS servers to support a new protocol and
format.

A web archive can can be created by any HTTP client that is capable of recording
its end of the HTTP network traffic. The goal of this specification is to
provide a way for a client that creates a web archive and stores it in the WACZ
format to also add authentication information.

This proposal will provide a mechanism to authenticate:

- an identity for the creator of the web archive
- a timestamp for when the web archive was created

This approach requires trusting the client, and possible trusted third party
'observer' that signs the web archive. This proposal does not make any
guarantees from the perspective of the web server serving the content, as this
is not currently possible with HTTP/S.

# WACZ Signature File and Format

The WACZ format builds on top of the [[FRICTIONLESS-DATA-PACKAGE]]. The data
package includes a manifest `datapackage.json` file which contains the hashes of
all the files in the data package.

A signed WACZ also contains a `datapackage-digest.json`, which contains a hash
and signature of the `datapackage.json`

(Note: While this specification is primarily designed for WACZ files, the
approach described here may be adapted to any Frictionless Data Package-based
specification)

    </section>
    <section data-format="markdown">

## Data Package Digest File

The `datapackage-digest.json` file, included in the root of the WACZ file, contains the following structure:

<pre class="example">
{
  "path": "datapackage.json",
  "hash": "sha256:3dd086a0be145d1108bf32a5cac7c4b4c046eb78365792d4bb28e9f43e3c6571",
  "signedData": &lt;Signature Data structure&gt;
}
</pre>

## Signature Data Format

The SignatureData structure is the output of the signing operation. 

There can only be one SignatureData object per WACZ file, stored as `signedData` in the root object present in `datapackage-digest.json`.

The SignatureData object MUST conform to one of the two signature formats described in this section:
- [Anonymous Signature](#anonymous-signature)
- [Domain-Ownership Identity + Signed Timestamp](#domain-ownership-identity-signed-timestamp)

The SignatureData object MUST not contain any property that is not listed in either signature format. 

### Anonymous Signature

<pre class="example">
{
    "hash": "&lt;sha256 hash of datapackage.json&gt;",
    "created": "&lt;ISO 8601 Date&gt;",
    "software": "&lt;string&gt;",
    "version": "&lt;string&gt;",
    "signature": "&lt;base64 encoded signature&gt;",
    "publicKey": "&lt;base64 encoded public key (ECDSA)&gt;"
}
</pre>

With this approach, the WACZ contains just enough to validate that they
signature with the `publicKey`.
  
To validate authorship of the WACZ, external key management is required, and
this signature is otherwise anonymous.
  
Currently, this approach is used in decentralized tooling, such as the
ArchiveWeb.page extension.

### Domain-Ownership Identity + Signed Timestamp

<pre class="example">
{
    "hash": &lt;sha256 hash of datapackage.json&gt;,
    "created": &lt;ISO 8601 Date&gt;,
    "software": &lt;string&gt;,
    "version": &lt;string&gt;,
  
    // signature of 'hash' by domainCert
    "signature": &lt;base64 encoded signature&gt;,
    "domain": &lt;valid hostname&gt;,
    "domainCert": &lt;PEM certificate chain&gt;,
  
    // signature of 'signature' by timestampCert
    "timeSignature": &lt;base64 encoded signature&gt;,
    "timestampCert": &lt;PEM ceriticate chain&gt;,
    
    // optional: cross-signing cert for "signature"
    "crossSignedCert": &lt;PEM certificate chain&gt;
}
</pre>

This approach allows for the WACZ signature to be created by the same private
key as is used to create a TLS certificate for a particular domain.
  
The creator of the WACZ file is the same as the owner of a particular TLS
certificate, which can be explored via Certificate Transparency logs.

This approach also includes an RFC 3161 timestamp server `timeSignature` of the
first `signature`.

The `timeSignature` includes the timestamped and is designed to further
guarantee that the signature was created close to the specified creation time.

For additional verification, an optional `crossSignedCert` can be provided which
can be used as an alternative to the `domainCert`, in case the domain
certificate has been found to be compromised for any reason. The cross-signed
certificate simply provides a way to provide an alternative trust path not tied
to the domainCert, if it becomes needed for any reason.

The `domainCert`, `timestampCert`, and `crossSignedCert` should include the full
certificate chain to aide in validation.

# Signing

To generate the `signedData`, the creator of the WACZ can perform the
following steps.

## Anonymous Signing

At minimum, the creator of the WACZ can create the anonymous signature
`signedData`, containing only its public key and signature.

With this approach, the client must distribute its public key out-of-band to
make WACZ verification possible.

## Domain-Name Identity + Timestamp Signing

To create the signedData in the second example, the client must perform the
following:

1. Generate a ECDSA private key.

2. Create a Certificate Request signed by the private key.

3. Receive a TLS certificate for its CSR from a trusted CA, such as LetsEncrypt.

4. Optionally: use a second CA (such as a private self-signed CA) to generate a
second cross-signed certificate as backup.

5. Sign the hash using its private key to generate the first signature
(signature)

6. Use an RFC 3161 timestamp server to sign the previous signature
(timeSignature)

This approach is based on a 'trusted-third party' which securely creates and
signs the WACZ files.

The intended workflow for this approach is that the creator of the WACZ has a
secure, private connection to the attestation server which is running on the
designated domain and can observe and sign the requested hash. Access to the
attestation server must be restricted to trusted creator of the WACZ.
Establishing this secure connection is beyond the scope of this specification.

    </section>
    <section data-format="markdown">

# Verification

Verification of a signed WACZ can involve the following steps:

1. Validate the WACZ as a Frictionless Data Package, ensuring the
`datapackage.json` hashes match the contents.

2. Validate that the `hash` in `datapackage-digest.json` matches
`datapackage.json`.

3. Verify that the `signedData` property of `datapackage-digest.json` is a [valid SignatureData object](#signature-data-format).

## Anonymous Signature Validation

Given an anonymous `signedData` with only a publicKey:

4. Validate the `signature` of the specified `hash` with the `publicKey`.

The WACZ file is thus valid, but publicKey must be validated using external
mechanisms.

## Domain-Name Identity + Timestamp Validation.

Given a signature data with domain-name signature + timestamp, the validation is
as follows:

4. Read the first certificate in `domainCert` certificate chain and validate
that `signature` is a valid signature of `hash` using the public key of the
certificate.

5. Verify that the `domain` matches the subjectName of the `domainCert` TLS
certificate.

6. Read the first certificate of `timestampCert` certificate chain and validate
that the `timeSignature` is a valid RFC 3161 timestamp signature of `signature`

7. Validate that the `created` date is within 10 minutes of the signed timestamp
in `timeSignature`

8. Verify trust of the `domainCert` certificate chain by checking trusted root
list. (Optionally, check for certificate revocation in Certificate Transparency
logs).

9. Verify trust of the `timestampCert` certificate chain by checking trusted
root list.

10. Optional: if `crossSignedCert` is provided, check that it has same public key
as `domainCert`, and check this chain in trusted root list. Or, if `domainCert`
is not trusted, use this trust path instead of `domainCert`.

## Verification of Partially loaded WACZ

The verification process above assumes a fully loaded WACZ file. However, WACZ
format supports partial loading of individual HTTP responses (via WARC records)
on demand.

For partial/on-demand loading, *Step 1* is modified as WARC files are not fully
loaded and can not be validated against the hash.

Instead, for each WARC record, verify the hash of the loaded WARC record with
the hash specified in the CDXJ index. If using a compressed CDXJ index, also
verify the hash of each compressed CDXJ block with the IDX index. (See the CDXJ
specification for more details).

# Implementations

Implementations of this spec exist in the following tools:

* The [authsign](https://github.com/webrecorder/authsign) library provides an
HTTP-based API for creating and validating a WACZ `signedData` for the
domain-name identity + timestamp approach. This  library uses the LetsEncrypt
service to generate a domain certificate on-demand, and the
[FreeTSA](https://freetsa.org/index_en.php) timestamping service to generate an
RFC 3161 timestamp.

* The [py-wacz](https://github.com/webrecorder/py-wacz) CLI tool can be used to
generate and validate WACZ file with domain-name identity + timestamp, by either
connecting to a `authsign` server via API for signing, or for validating
directly via the CLI.

* The [ArchiveWeb.page](https://archiveweb.page) extension produces signed WACZ
files with an anonymous `signedData`. The publicKey is not yet distributed
outside the extension.
