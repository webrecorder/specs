# Introduction

This specification defines a directory structure and <a>ZIP</a> format
specification for sharing and distributing <a>web archives</a>. <a>ZIP</a> files
using this format can be referred to as <a>WACZ</a> (Web Archive Collection
Zipped).

## Motivation

The goal of this specification is to provide a portable format for 
<a>web archives</a> in order to achieve two broad goals for web archives:

1. *Social*: to provide an interoperable way of sharing web archive
<a>collections</a> that includes the <a>contextual information</a> needed 
   for users to interpret and meaningfully interact with them.

2. *Technical*: to provide an efficient way to dynamically load 
   *small amounts of data* from a remotely hosted file  
   on static storage, without requiring the entire file 
   to be downloaded, or for the intervention of specialized 
   server side applications.

To use and make sense of a web archive collection, it is necessary to have the
archived web content as well as <a>contextual information</a> that describes what the
collection contains as well as when and how it was created. The collection also
requires a set of entry points or <a>pages</a> to use for browsing the collection.

All of this data needs to be <a>packaged</a> together so that the various pieces can be
easily copied and transferred without accidentally separating them. This data
package needs to to be easily transported from one storage system to another, 
sent as an attachment in an email, placed on a thumb drive, and hosted by simply
serving it up at a given URL as a static document, possibly from cloud object
storage, or a CDN.

Hosting web archives currently requires complex server infrastructure (e.g. a
<a>Wayback Machine</a>) to serve <a>WARC</a> data in such a way that can be
viewed in the browser. The <a>WACZ</a> format provides a storage approach
optimized for efficient random-access to <a>packaged</a> up WARC data that allows 
the browser to render a page by fetching only what is needed for that
particular page. This is done by leveraging the <a>ZIP</a> format's built-in
index to locate the contents of the web archive and its constituent metadata.

WACZ is not designed to replace other web archiving formats. Rather it
establishes a file <a>packaging</a> convention for all the data needed by a browser for
efficient rendering of a web archive collection, and its contextualization.

## Existing Tools 

The [py-wacz](https://github.com/webrecorder/py-wacz) repository contains a
reference implementation for creating WACZ files from existing WARC files, and
validating them. Parts of the specification are also implemented and in use by
[wabac.js](https://github.com/webrecorder/wabac.js) and
[ReplayWeb.page](https://replayweb.page).

    </section>

    <section data-format="markdown">

# WACZ Object

A WACZ object consists of the following:

1. A `datapackage.json` file for recording technical and descriptive metadata
   specified in [[FRICTIONLESS-DATA-PACKAGE]].

2. An extensible directory and naming convention for <a>web archive</a> data.

3. A method for bundling the directory layout in a <a>ZIP</a> file.

## Directory Layout

A <a>WACZ</a> contains a directory structure, that contains web archive
collection data which MUST conform to the [[FRICTIONLESS-DATA-PACKAGE]]
specification. This directory structure looks like:

<pre class="example">
├── archive
│   └── data.warc.gz
├── datapackage.json
├── datapackage-digest.json
├── indexes
│   └── index.cdx.gz
└── pages
    └── pages.jsonl
</pre>

## Directories and Files

### archive

The `archive` directory MUST contain one or more files in the [[WARC]] format. 
The files SHOULD use the `.warc` file extension unless they are GZIP encoded in 
which case they MUST use the `.warc.gz` file extension.

<pre class="example">
archive
└── data.warc
</pre>

### indexes

The `indexes` directory MUST include one or more indexes for the WARC data stored
in `archive`. These index files allow clients to efficiently look up a URL to
see if it is contained in the WACZ. Index files MUST contain CDXJ data
and MAY be gzip compressed [[PYWB-CDXJ]].

<pre class="example">
indexes
└── index.cdx.gz
</pre>

### pages.jsonl

The `pages/pages.jsonl` MUST be present and include a list of 'Page' objects as
[[JSON-Lines]] where each line MUST contain at least the following properties:

- `url` - a URL for the page
- `ts` - a [[RFC3339]] datetime string

Each entry in the [[JSONL]] file MAY contain the following properties to aid in
navigating a web archive collection:

- `title` - a string describing the resource
- `id` - an arbitrary identifier for the resource
- `text` - text extracted from the snapshot
- `size` - an integer that representes the number of bytes for the page and all its resources

<pre class="example">
{"format": "json-pages-1.0", "id": "pages", "title": "All Pages"}
{"id": "1db0ef709a", "url": "https://www.example.com/page", "ts": "2020-10-07T21:22:36Z", "title": "Example Domain"}
{"id": "12304e6ba9", "url": "https://www.example.com/another", "ts": "2020-10-07T21:23:36Z", "title": "Another Page"}
</pre>

Each entry in the [[JSONL]] file MAY contain additional properties as long as
they do not interfere with the required properties.

Other [[JSONL]] files MAY be added on using the same format in the `pages/`
directory. A common use case is to include only the main pages in the
`pages.jsonl`, while including additional pages, such as those discovered
automatically via a crawl in an another file e.g. `extraPages.jsonl`.

### datapackage.json

The `datapackage.json` file MUST be present at the root of the WACZ which
serves as the manifest for the web archive and is compliant with the
[[FRICTIONLESS-DATA-PACKAGE]] specification. It MUST contain the following
properties:

- `profile`: the string `data-package`
- `resources`: a list of file names, paths, sizes and fixity for all files
   contained in the WACZ.
- `wacz_version`: the version of WACZ used, for example `1.1.1`

<pre class="example">
{
  "profile": "data-package",
  "wacz_version": "1.1.1",
  "resources": [
     {
       "name": "pages.jsonl",
       "path": "pages/pages.jsonl",
       "hash": "sha256:8a7fc0d302700bed02294404a627ddbbf0e35487565b1c6181c729dff8d2fff6",
       "bytes": 75
     },
     {
       "name": "data.warc",
       "path": "archive/data.warc",
       "hash": "sha256:0e7101316ba5d4b66f86a371ee615fbd20f9d3f32d32563ed2c829db062f7714",
       "bytes": 11469796
     }
  ]
}
</pre>

The `datapackage.json` SHOULD include properties that allow rendering
applications to present the user with <a>contextual information</a> about the
web archive:

- `title`: a string or one sentence description for the collection
- `description`: a longer description of the archive's contents 
   which MUST be Markdown formatted (plain text is valid Markdown)
- `created`: a [[RFC3339]] datetime for when the WACZ file was created
- `modified`: a [[RFC3339]] datetime for when the WACZ file was last modified
- `software`: A description of what software was used to create the WACZ file
- `mainPageUrl`: An optional URL of the main or starting page in the collection
  to be used for initial replay
- `mainPageDate`: An optional ISO-formatted date of the main or startng page in 
  the collection to be used for initial replay

Other properties from the [[FRICTIONLESS-DATA-PACKAGE]] specification such as
`licenses`, `version`, `organization`, `contributors`, `email` MAY be used. 
Custom properties that do not interfere with pre-existing properties MAY also 
be used.

### datapackage-digest.json

A `datapackage-digest.json` file SHOULD be included in the root of the WACZ to
verify the `datapackage.json` manifest with a hash and thus for the entire
contents of the WACZ. If present the following properties MUST be included:

* `path`: the string "datapackage.json"
* `hash`: a cryptographic hash for the `datapackage.json` file

<pre class="example">
{
  "path": "datapackage.json",
  "hash": "sha256:ec1f44ab13e2c94b0ddf66e9673d585ba4a77e6f8c9cc30d8665da434557e885"
}
</pre>

## Other files and directories

Other files and directories MAY be present in a WACZ as long as they do 
not interfere with specified files and directories that are used by WACZ.
Specifically, custom files and directories MUST NOT be added to the existing WACZ directories, `archive`, `indexes` and `pages`. Additional files MUST be listed in the resources section of `datapackage.json` to ensure conformance with [[FRICTIONLESS-DATA-PACKAGE]]

## Zip Format

The entire directory structure MUST be stored in a standard [[ZIP]] file.

### Zip Compression

Already compressed files MUST NOT be compressed again to allow for random access.

- All `archive/` files should be stored in ZIP with 'STORE' mode.
- All `index/*.cdx.gz` files should be stored in ZIP with 'STORE' mode.
- All files (`*.jsonl`, `*.json`, `*.idx`, `*.cdx`, `*.cdxj`) can be stored in 
  the ZIP with either 'DEFLATE' or 'STORE' mode.

### Zip Format File Extension

A ZIP file that follows this Web Archive Collection format spec MUST use the extension `.wacz`.

Such a file can be referred to as a WACZ file or a WACZ.

    </section>

    <section data-format="markdown">

# Processing Model

The [[ZIP]] file format provides efficient random access, which means archived
web pages can be retrieved efficiently even from large web archive collections
without requiring the entire WACZ to be transferred. To achieve this WACZ
clients can read portions of the ZIP file on-demand using HTTP RANGE requests
[[RFC7233]].

The processing model works as follows. Given a ZIP file, a client can quickly:

1. Read all entries to determine the contents of the ZIP file
2. Load collection metadata from the `datapackage.json`
3. Load a list of pages from `pages.jsonl`, if any

To lookup a given URL the client needs to:

1. Read the full CDX from ZIP
2. Binary search index looking for the URL
3. If a match found, get offset/length/location in WARC
4. Read compressed WARC chunk in ZIP

This approach is being used by [ReplayWeb.page](https://replayweb.page)

    </section>

    <section data-format="markdown">

# Publishing

Because they are ZIP files WACZ can be hosted on the web as static files. This
allows web archives to be easily maintained over time without relying on complex
server side software, apart from widely available, open source, and well tested
web server applications. If desirable WACZ files can be managed and made
accessibile using HTTP object stores available from cloud hosting providers, and
content deliver networks that geographically position web-archives closer to
their users. However there are certain considerations to make when publishing
WACZ files.

## Content-Length

WACZ clients need to know how large an entire WACZ file is in order to
download it prior to rendering, or to read it dynamically. To support this HTTP
responses for WACZ files MUST use the `Content-Length` HTTP header.

## Partial Requests

Clients that render WACZ files typically need to be able to fetch content from
the WACZ file on demand. For example when displaying archived content for a
given URL that URL needs to be looked up in the CDXJ index, and the byte offsets
from the index entry are then used to retrieve a portion of a given WARC file
that is enclosed in the WACZ.

In order for clients to be able to perform this dynamic retrieval web servers
that publish WACZ files MUST support HTTP range requests [[RFC7233]]. HTTP
responses for WACZ HTTP requests SHOULD server WACZ files using the
`Accept-Ranges` HTTP header.

## CORS

WACZ files and the their clients MAY be served from the same host name. However
it can be useful to view the web archive from a host name that is distinct from
the host name that is publishing the WACZ file. For example this is the
case when publishing WACZ files using a cloud provider's HTTP object storage
(e.g. `s3.amazonaws.com`) and making it viewable at another domain (`e.g.
example.org`). It also is the case when WACZ publishers want to allow their web
archives to circulate on the web, and be viewable in multiple locations.

For security reasons browsers restrict access to files hosted on a
different domain than the websites that is trying to load them. In order to
support loading from different domains WACZ files SHOULD be made available using
the `access-control-allow-origin` [[CORS]] HTTP header.

## Media Type

WACZ HTTP responses for WACZ files SHOULD be published with the
`application/wacz` media type.

## Example Response

Given these requirements a minimal HTTP response for a WACZ could look
like:

<pre class="example">
HTTP/2 200
Content-Type: application/wacz
Content-Length: 20961755
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
